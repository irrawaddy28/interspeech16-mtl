The three most common and typical types of references used in
IEEE publications:

an article in a journal
Note the use of the IEEE_J_EDL string, defined in the IEEEabrv.bib file,
for the journal name. IEEEtran.bst defines the BibTeX standard three
letter month codes per IEEE style.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices",
page 996, reference #16.
@article{IEEEexample:article_typical,
  author        = "S. Zhang and C. Zhu and J. K. O. Sin and P. K. T. Mok",
  title         = "A Novel Ultrathin Elevated Channel Low-temperature 
                   Poly-{Si} {TFT}",
  journal       = IEEE_J_EDL,
  volume        = "20",
  month         = nov,
  year          = "1999",
  pages         = "569-571"
}


journal article using et al.
The (five) authors are actually: F. Delorme, S. Slempkes, G. Alibert, 
B. Rose, J. Brandon
The month (July) was not given here.
From the September 1998 issue of "IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in
Communications", page 1257, reference #28.
@article{IEEEexample:articleetal,
  author        = "F. Delorme and others",

  year          = "1995",
  pages         = "1244-1245"
}


a paper in a conference proceedings
"conference" can be used as an alias for "inproceedings"
From the June 2002 issue of "Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems",
page 205, reference #16.
@inproceedings{IEEEexample:conf_typical,
  author        = "R. K. Gupta and S. D. Senturia",

  month         = jan,
  year          = "1997",
  pages         = "290-294"
}


a book
From the May 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Magnetics",
page 1466, reference #4.
@book{IEEEexample:book_typical,

  publisher     = "Addison-Wesley",
  address       = "Reading, MA",
  year          = "1972"
}




Other examples

journal article with large page numbers, IEEE will divide numbers 5 digits
or longer into groups of three with small spaces between them. Page ranges
can be separated via either "-" or "--", IEEEtran.bst will automatically
convert the separator dash(es) to "--".
Authors and/or IEEE do not always provide/use the journal number, but it
was used in this case. IEEEtran.bst can be configured to ignore journal
numbers if desired.
From the August 2000 issue of "IEEE Photonics Technology Letters",
page 1039, reference #11.
@article{IEEEexample:articlelargepages,
  author        = "A. Castaldini and A. Cavallini and B. Fraboni
                   and P. Fernandez and J. Piqueras",
  title         = "Midgap Traps Related to Compensation Processes in
                   {CdTe} Alloys",
  journal       = "Phys. Rev. B.",
  volume        = "56",
  number        = "23",
  year          = "1997",
  pages         = "14897-14900"
}


journal article with dual months 
use the BibTeX "#" concatenation operator
From the March 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Mechatronics",
page 21, reference #8.
@article{IEEEexample:articledualmonths,
  author        = "Y. Okada and K. Dejima and T. Ohishi",

  year          = "1995",
  pages         = "1047-1053"
}


journal article to be published as a misc entry type
date information like month and year is optional 
However, the article form like that below may be a better approach.
From the May 2002 issue of "IEEE Journal of Selected Areas in 
Communication", page 725, reference #3.
@misc{IEEEexample:TBPmisc,
  author        = "M. Coates and A. Hero and R. Nowak and B. Yu",

  month         = may,
  year          = "2002",
  note          = "to be published"
}


journal article to be published as an article entry type
year is required, so if absent, use the year field to hold
the "submitted for publication" in order to avoid a warning for
the missing year field.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",
page 1461, reference #21.
@article{IEEEexample:TBParticle,
  author        = "N. Kahale and R. Urbanke",

                   Concatenated Codes",
  journal       = IEEE_J_IT,
  year          = "submitted for publication"
}





book with editor and no author
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",
page 1725, reference #1.
@book{IEEEexample:bookwitheditor,
  editor        = "J. C. Candy and G. C. Temes",

                   Design and Simulation",
  publisher     = "{IEEE} Press.",
  address       = "New York",
  year          = "1992"
}


book with edition, author and editor
Note that the standard BibTeX styles do not support book entries with both
author and editor fields, but IEEEtran.bst does.
The standard BibTeX way of specifying the edition is to use capitalized
ordinal words such as "First", "Second", etc. Most .bst files can convert
up to about "Fifth" into the format needed. IEEEtran.bst can convert up
to "Tenth" to the "Arabic ordinal" form IEEE uses (e.g., "10th"). For
editions over the tenth, it is best to use the "Arabic ordinal" form for
IEEE related work (e.g., "101st")
Note how "Jr." has to be entered.

U.S. patent
Use the type field to override the patent type. e.g.,
type = "Patent Application"
The address is that of the assignee. Note that IEEE does not
display the assignee, the address, and only displays one date.
(if year is not present, the filed dates are used.) However, this
information should be entered as other BibTeX styles may use it.
alternatively, nationality could be entered as "U.S." 
From the April 2000 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Communications",
page 542, reference #6.
@patent{IEEEexample:uspat,
  author        = "Ronald E. Sorace and Victor S. Reinhardt and

French Patent request, the language field must be entered in lower case
as this is the option name Babel uses. The nationality field needs to be
capitalized. Because this is a patent request, the date filed fields are
used while the date fields are left empty/missing. In other countries,
the words "Patent Application", etc. are used instead.

Other unusual references

a private communication as a misc entry type
sometimes the designation "personal communication" is used instead

@misc{IEEEexample:private,
  author        = "S. Konyagin",
  howpublished  = "private communication",
  year          = "1998"

an internet request for comments (RFC) as a misc entry type
It would also be nice to add a URL to these types of things.
RFCs can also be handled as electronic references.
From the April 2002 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 181, reference #14.
@misc{IEEEexample:miscrfc,
  author        = "K. K. Ramakrishnan and S. Floyd",
  title         = "A Proposal to Add Explicit Congestion
                   Notification ({ECN}) to {IP}",

a software package as a manual
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE/ASME Journal of Microelectromechanical
Systems", page 205, reference #20.
Sometimes they put the version/release information in the title.

  address       = "Beaverton, OR",
  year          = "1998",
  note          = "Release 4.3"
}


a software package as an electronic reference
From the February 2003 issue of  "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 46, reference #24. If there is no author or organization, a sorting
key is required for sorting styles. It might be a good idea to include
month and year fields as well.
@electronic{IEEEexample:softonline,
  title         = "Ucb/lbnl/vint Network Simulator---ns (Version 2)",
  url           = "http://www-mash.cs.berkeley.edu/ns/",
  key           = "ns"

misc for a German regulation
In German, the first letters of nouns are capitalized, so we do so here.

Ways to handle things like CCSDS's Blue Books
journal article with a URL. However, this is not a very good approach
because the Blue Books are not really journals and the author field has
to be abused.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",
page 1461, reference #7.
@article{IEEEexample:bluebookarticle,
  author        = "{Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)}",
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  journal       = "Blue Book",
  number        = "4",
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}


CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a book
However, it is not a good idea to have to use the author field for
an organization (done here because the book entry type requires an
author field).
@book{IEEEexample:bluebookbook,
  author        = "{Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)}",
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  series        = "Blue Book",
  number        = "4",
  publisher     = "{CCSDS}",
  address       = "Newport Beach, {CA}",
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}


CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a manual
This is a much better approach, but uses the howpublished field.
@manual{IEEEexample:bluebookmanual,
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  howpublished  = "ser. Blue Book, No. 4",
  organization  = "Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)",
  address       = "Newport Beach, CA",
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}



CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a standard
Probably the best approach for this particular case because the work
is standard related. Note that IEEE does not display the address for
standards.

  howpublished  = "ser. Blue Book, No. 4",

Early paper on speech enhancement using DNNs. They use log power spectral features as input to the DNN with MMSE error criterion.
Input feats were normalized to 0 mean and unit variance. DNN used 3 hidden layers with 2048 nodes per layer. 100 hours of training data. DNNs initialized with
RBM pre-training.

Three improvements over their previous paper [Xu-DNNWithoutGlobVarEq] are: First, over-smoothing issue (muffled speech) alleviated after scaling and translating
the DNN output using a global variance equalization factor (see eq. 6-9). Second, dropout training was included to generalized well across unseen noises. Note that dropout doesn't lead to denoising, it only increases generalization capability. Third, noise aware training was incorporated.

DRDAE (Deep RNN DAE), 3 hidden layers, only 2nd layer is the temporal (recurrent) layer. MSE optimized. Two key results:
1. They show that having deep and recurrent layers outperform shallow and non-recurrent neural nets (DRDAE > RDAE > DDAE > DAE). 
2. They also showed that enhanced features are more useful than enhanced posteriors for ASR. In a Tandem system, they trained a DRNN to output clean posteriors from input noisy features. The estimated posteriors are fed to an HMM system to do ASR. In the DRDAE system, they trained a DRNN to output clean features from noisy features. The estimated (enhanced) features are fed to an HMM system to do ASR. Result: DRDAE outperform the Tandem set-up.

Three improvements over their previous paper [Mass-DRDAE]. First, we apply cepstral mean and variance normalization (CMVN)  independently to both the input and output features. CMVN serves to normalize utterances which otherwise have large differences in feature norm across SNRs. We note that CMVN is similar to whitening procedures widely used to improve performance of neural network models on computer vision tasks. Second, we include an estimate of the background noise at each frame along with the input window of acoustic features. There is no requirement of uncorrelated inputs, and during training the model can learn to combine inputs appropriately. Third, we extend the DRDAE architecture by adding a “short circuit” layer – a linear weight matrix mapping from the input
features directly to the output. This direct output pathway improves performance in high SNR conditions where the correct
feature transformation is close to the identity function.

The paper reports a light weight DNN recipe for denoising: MSE error criterion, single hidden layer of 2000 units, modified ReLU, no temporal memory, input context window of 3 frames, magnitude spectra features, no input normalization (0 mean, unit var) of the features and the training set is only with a single SNR level (0dB). This recipe performs well since no additional complexities were required.

Key idea: Multisoftmax. They introduce a multisoftmax approach to separation where softmax-1 is trained to predict the target and softmax-2 is trained to predict the interferer. Note that this is a supervised separation method since it is assumed that both the target speaker and interferer are known during the training stage. In the semi-supervised method, the target is known but the interferer is unknown. As a workaround, speech from multiple interfering speakers were mixed with the target speaker in the training stage. In the test stage, they try to separate the speech of the unknown interfering speaker.

Key ideas: 4 methods for noise robustness (NR) in DNNs are suggested. 
NR in HMMs generally fall into two categories: Feature enhancement and model adaptation. In model adaptation, the features are unchanged. Instead, the model parameters are updated to better represent the observed speech. The authors propose different
NR methods for DNN that are analogous to NR methods for HMM:
- training with multi-condition data: Training a DNN on multi-condition data enables the network to learn higher level features that are more invariant to the effects of noise with respect to classification accuracy.
- training with enhanced features: The simplest way to reduce the effect of noise on the DNN is to simply process the data using a feature enhancement algo-
rithm prior to training the network. In particular, the authors use the feature enhancement algorithm based on the Cepstral-domain Minimum Mean Squared Error (C-MMSE) criterion. This enhancement algorithm is based on the classic Log-MMSE noise suppression algorithm proposed by Ephraim and Malah. The enhanced features are fed to the DNN for training. This is the feature enhancement method.
- noise aware training: The relationship between x, y, and n in the log spectral domain is typically approximated as y = x + log(1 + exp(n − x)). The DNN tries to learn this mapping during training w/o us telling the DNN about the functional form of y. To enable this, we augment each observation input to the network with an estimate of the noise present in the signal. Because this is done in both training and decoding, this is analogous to noise adaptive training without an explicit mismatch function. Instead, the DNN is being given additional cues in order to automatically learn the relationship between noisy speech and noise
in a way that is beneficial to predict senone posterior probabilities. Because the DNN is being informed about the noise, but not explicitly adapted, we adopt slightly different terminology and refer to this method as noise-aware training. This is analogous to the model adaptation method.
- dropout training: this is not for denoising. It is improving the generalization capability of the DNN to unseen noise types. 
The authors report DNN with noise-aware training + dropout yields the lowest WER.

Key ideas of this paper are: a) joint training: a deterministic masking layer, on top of an RNN, is jointly trained with the RNN b) discriminative training: the network is trained using a discriminative criterion to reduce intereference c) model both target and interfering sources through the multisoftmax architecture.  The paper reports improvements in separating male and female speech compared to the NMF method.

This one is similar to [Huang-DRNNMonoauralSep] in terms of ideas. The main differences are: a) separates singing-voice from background music

Two key contributions: a) They train a DNN using segment level acoustic features to get a vector of posterior probabilities of dimension equal to the number of emotion
states (K). Using 4 statistical functions - max, min, avg, percentage - they derive a 4 dimensional global feature vector for each emotion using the segment level posteriors obtained from the DNN. b) Then they train an extreme learning machine (ELM), a light weight single layer NN, using the global features of the DNN and output a vector of dimension K representing the score of each emotion. 
Note: Before training the DNN, the authors select only 10\% of the high energy segments for a given training utterance. To these segments, they assign the same emotion label since the corpus supplies label at the utterance level rather than at the segment or frame level.
@inproceedings{Han-EmotionDNNELM,
  title			= "Speech emotion recognition using deep neural network and extreme learning machine",
  author		= "K. Han and D. Yu and I. Tashnev",
  booktitle		= {Interspeech}, 
  pages     		= {},
  year			= "2014",
}

Two key contributions: a) CTC to find the time alignment of the emotional labels for training a frame level neural network. b) Extension of Han's 'DNN-ELM work to include BLSTM since it can model temporal contexts more than 250 ms long. ([14, 21] in the paper conclude that emotion information is contained in segments more than 250ms long).
Note about b): in the corpus usually an emotion label is usually supplied at the utterance level rather than at the frame level. But assigning all frames within 
the utterance with the same emotion is perhaps not accurate. There may be segment with neutral emotion. Hence, the authors label the varying length segments (note: this is not at the frame level but at the segment level) with a 3-state Markov chain (null-emotion-null) and concatenate the segments to form a sequence of states. Now it remains to find the proper time boundaries of these states. They use CTC to do this.
With this, they train a BLSTM (2 layers, 128 cells - 64 foward, 64 backward) using MFCC+Pitch+ZCR+Voice-probability as acoustic features and x-ent criterion to get
posterior probability vectors for each frame. The dim of prob. vector is the same as the no. of emotion states. They extract global features by applying 
statistical functions to the frame level posterior prob. vectors. The global features are fed to an ELM for final classification.
