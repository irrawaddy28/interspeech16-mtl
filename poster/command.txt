# Compilation of poster.tex depends on baposter.cls. The cls file follows the
# pdflatex method rather than the latex+dvips method. Hence, do not compile
# poster.tex with latex+dvips. This also means all images/figs etc in
# poster.tex file must be either JPEG/PDF/PNG format. They cannot be in EPS format.

pdflatex --enable-write18  poster.tex
